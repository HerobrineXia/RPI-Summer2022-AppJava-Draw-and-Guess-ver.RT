### Background
"Draw & Guess” is a very popular online guessing game nowadays. In a game, the system will provide players with multiple keywords to draw and create. The player then needs to use the mouse or touchpad to draw the specific word given by the system, and send it to the next player to guess after the drawing is done. At the same time, the previous player will also complete the drawing and hand it over to you for guessing. At the end, this error of information transmission often forms a humorous and funny misunderstanding, thus achieving the entertainment of the game. However, in this respect, the existing rules of the game require the user to answer questions in multiplayer mode asynchronously (i.e., you have to finish the painting before you can answer the question), which slows down the pace of the game and makes it boring because of the repetitive work (one needs to paint multiple paintings to complete a round). 

Therefore, we integrated the early Internet chat room function into the game based on JavaFX and network programming ideas, so that during one person’s drawing, other players would be set in the chat room to watch the drawing process and provide potential answers in real time in the chat room. When any one of the players guesses correctly, the round is over.
